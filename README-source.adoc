= {productName} Quickstarts

[toc]

[abstract]
The quickstarts demonstrate {javaVersion} and a few additional technologies from the {productNameFull} stack. They provide small, specific, working examples that can be used as a reference for your own project.

[[introduction]]
== Introduction

These quickstarts run on the WildFly application server. The quickstarts are configured to use the correct Maven dependencies and ensure that you test and compile the quickstarts against the correct runtime environment.

Each quickstart folder contains a `README-source.adoc` file that describes the quickstart features and provides instructions about how to build and run it. Instructions are provided to build the more readable `README.html` files.

Make sure you read this entire document before you attempt to work with the quickstarts.

[[system_requirements]]
== System Requirements

The applications these projects produce are designed to be run on {productNameFull} {productVersion} or later.

All you need to build these projects is {buildRequirements}.

[[use_of_product_home_and_jboss_home_variables]]
== Use of WILDFLY_HOME and QUICKSTART_HOME Variables

The quickstart `README` files use the _replaceable_ value `__WILDFLY_HOME__` to denote the path to the WildFly server. When you encounter this value in a `README` file, make sure you replace it with the actual path to your WildFly server.

When you see the replaceable variable __QUICKSTART_HOME__, replace it with the path to the root directory of all of the quickstarts.

[[suggested_approach_to_the_quickstarts]]
== Suggested Approach to the Quickstarts

We recommend that you approach the quickstarts as follows:

* Regardless of your level of expertise, we suggest you start with the `helloworld` quickstart. It is the simplest example and is an easy way to prove the server is configured and running correctly.
* If you are a beginner or new to JBoss, start with the quickstarts labeled `Beginner`, then try those marked as `Intermediate`. When you are comfortable with those, move on to the `Advanced` quickstarts.
* Some quickstarts are based upon other quickstarts but have expanded capabilities and functionality. If a prerequisite quickstart is listed, make sure you deploy and test it before looking at the expanded version.

The root folder of each individual quickstart contains a `README.html` file with detailed instructions on how to build and run the example.

[[introduction]]
== Introduction

These quickstarts run on {productNameFull} {productVersion}.

We recommend that you use the *{quickstartDownloadName}* ZIP file, which you can download from the {quickstartDownloadUrl}[{productName} Software Download] page on the Red Hat Customer Portal. This version of the quickstarts uses the correct dependencies and ensures that you test and compile against the correct server runtime environment.

Each quickstart folder contains a `README{outfilesuffix}` file that describes the quickstart features and provides instructions about how to build and run it.

Make sure you read this entire document before you attempt to work with the quickstarts.

ifdef::ProductRelease,EAPXPRelease[]
// System Requirements are not needed for the CD Releases, only for the Product and XP Release.

[[use_of_product_home_and_jboss_home_variables]]
== Use of {jbossHomeName} and QUICKSTART_HOME Variables

The quickstart `README` files use the _replaceable_ value `__{jbossHomeName}__`  to denote the path to the {productName} installation. When you encounter this value in a `README` file, make sure you replace it with the actual path to your {productName} installation. The installation path is described in detail here: link:{useProductHomeDocUrl}[Use of __{jbossHomeName}__ and __JBOSS_HOME__ Variables]

When you see the replaceable variable __QUICKSTART_HOME__, replace it with the path to the root directory of all of the quickstarts.

[[available_quickstarts]]
== Table of Available Quickstarts

The sources for all available quickstarts, which are listed in the following table, can be found here: {githubRepoUrl}.

Each quickstart provides the list of technologies demonstrated by the quickstart and the required experience level needed to build and deploy it. Click on the quickstart link in the table to see more detailed information about how to run it. Some quickstarts require deployment of other quickstarts. This information is noted in the `Prerequisites` section of the quickstart `README.html` file.

NOTE: Some of these quickstarts use the H2 database included with {productNameFull} {productVersion}. It is a lightweight, relational example datasource that is used for examples only. It is not robust or scalable, is not supported, and should NOT be used in a production environment!
